# YPDrawSignatureView

I could not find a good signature capturer iOS made in Swift, so I gave it a try. I leaned heavily on the blog entry [Capture a Signature on iOS](https://www.altamiracorp.com/blog/employee-posts/capture-a-signature-on-ios) by Jason Harwig, and [Macheads101](https://www.youtube.com/user/macheads101), he has a great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KV1o9hPF5E&list=UU7fIuG6L5EPc9Ijq2_BCmIg) on YouTube.


## Usage

Add a new `view` where you want the signature capture field. Set its class to `YPDrawSignatureView`, and connect it to an `IBOutlet` property in your `UIViewController` (or whatever else).


## Installation

Add YPDrawSignature.swift to your project
